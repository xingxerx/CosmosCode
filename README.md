# CosmosCode
Cosmology and Medicine Codebase

## Overview
CosmosCode is a project that combines cosmology simulations with medical applications.

## Installation

### Node.js Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Python Dependencies
We use micromamba to manage Python environments:

```bash
# Install micromamba if you don't have it
# See: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

node index.js
```

### With Python Integration
```bash
./run-with-python.sh
```

## Testing

### Node.js Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Python Tests
```bash
./run-python-tests.sh
```
